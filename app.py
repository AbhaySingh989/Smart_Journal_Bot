# --- ASYNCIO EVENT LOOP IN A SEPARATE THREAD ---
# This is the standard pattern for using an asyncio library (like python-telegram-bot)
# with a synchronous web framework (like Flask).
# We create a single, persistent event loop in a background thread.
# The Flask app can then safely submit work to this loop from its request threads.

# 1. Create a new event loop that will run in the background.
loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()

# 2. Define the function that will run in the background thread.
